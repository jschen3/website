angular, bootstrap, html5, model view controller, website
I adapted a coding challenge to a project to display on github and the model view controller framework. I think this project really shows what you can do with angular and bootstrap to build a pretty user friendly framework. Additionally I feel the code is simple and clean proper use of each piece of angular to build the website. Also the services can be quickly adapted to make it real catalog.
