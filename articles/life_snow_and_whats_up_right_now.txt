I suppose I am doing roughly 3 major things.

I am working. I got a job at Ricoh and I just started this week on february 1st and thats quite an experience. I have interned at Ricoh for the past 2 summers and lived colorado all my life so I am familiar with it but I feel really self conscious on my skills and abilities. I feel that I am quite a good programmer and I can do well, but I don't know how I compare to everybody else. I guess I'll see though.

Second I'm trying to connect more and find some new social groups in Boulder and this area. The weather has been kind of forbidding but its a working process. Seems like meetups.com will work but I need to go to some of the events.

Third I'm reading a ton. I love to read and somehow in the last week I chewed through 3 full novels. So here are some more pics of some books I read and the snow.
