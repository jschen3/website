So lets get into it what is the competance complex.

The compentance complex is a the moral debate between asking questions and trying to figure it out yourself. Asking a senior employee significantly discounts the time it takes to solve the problem, but it makes you sound significantly less competant and capable of solving the problem yourself. To add to the compexity, employees are encouraged to show initiative in asking for help and asking for help can inconvenience the senior employees in their own tasks. So I constantly debate what is the proper solution. Lately I have been procastinating asking for help, perhaps to my detriment. I honestly don't know and grapple with this idea constantly.

To add with this original complex is my innate lack of confidence. I learned throughout college and innumerous competitions I went through that I am not special, I am not the best. There are hundreds of millions of people that are better than me. But whatevers life goes on. I'll keep messing up and trying.
