The Masteries of Donald Trump
03 30 2016
Despite the rather large amount of buffooneries Donald Trump commits, I believe a few of his remarks are worth note and deserve the article I am writing today. And thus I want to discuss his geniuses in manipulating the media, his ability to tap in to discontent of the American public, his tax plan; And a few of his astounding demerits namely his lack of experience, his endlessly shifting positions and his grand wall.

First of all, no one deny it, for some reason, the media and everyone like to talk about Donald Trump. Why is that? No one really knows. I personally feel its his ability to sensationalize everything and the sensational nature of his comments. People like action and his opinions are definetely extreme and inspire action. Whats really suprising though is how no one really pay attention to the craziness of his remarks. Romney's presidential campaign was lost on the single remark about 47%. Whereas Donald Trump constantly marginalizes muslims, women, minorities etc. This manipulation of the media is undeniably although probably not entirely purposefully, is definetely genius.

Second his ability to tap into the discontent of the American people. Donald Trump definetely chose the right time to run for president. The United States just got out of the second greatest depression ever and all the voters still have that on the center of their minds. The American people are angry about change and his ideas on what is causing the upheaval and change make sense to the sometimes misinformed populace. The United States is currently going through a revolution, never before seen since the industrial revolution and they feel Donald Trump will change this revolution for the better.

Third his tax and business plan are largely resonable. The United States tax plan with so many divisions and deductions needs to be simplified. I believe the simplicity of his plan breaking the United States into a smaller amount of income brackets and having a flat tax on the cooperation is the right starting point. More taxes need to be added to reduce the deficit though. In its current form assuming all current expenses stay the same with Donald Trump's plan the budget dificit doubles per year.

Next his 3 most significiant demerits in my opinion atleast. First I feel Donald Trump does not have the experience to be president. The president is an incredibly stressful job. A single word or speech has resounding effects accross the world. Trump has never dealt with that kind of pressure. The closes analogy in Donald Trump has is running his business which by any metric is molecular compared to the United States. All other candidates have been in the government which allows some metric on how the government works.

Second his wavering opinion. Donald Trump has said so many ludicrist things no one is entirely sure of his opinion on anything. At one moment he praises the good of planned parenthood; the next he decries abortion and threatens to punish abortees. A president cannot differ so monumentally, as everyone looks to him to begin to establish opinions and policy.

Lastly the wall accross is Mexico is perhaps the most stupid thing ever. It is pointless to build, and likely won't make a difference in border crossings. The effort to build the wall would be put to significantly better use improving US infastructure. Already a significant amount of the border is covered by walls, although less tall and sturdy than those proposed by Donald Trump, they have minimal effect. Why would a slightly taller wall decrease deportations. They just project an image of protection.
